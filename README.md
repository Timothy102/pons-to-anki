# Pons to Anki 

Pons Translator API works together with Anki to Automate Translation

## High-level Overview

This application was devised out of a problem I had with translation. This setup & application can serve as your own personal tool for enhancing langauge translation on your PC as well as reduce the time taken on such tasks

### How does it work?

- you find a word and you type it into an empty file -> utilize keyboard shortcuts
- on your callback, the words get inserted into a pipeline (From local file to PonsAPITranslator for your desired language)
- the words along with their translations get stored into a new file
- Anki SDK picks those up and stores them into their designated flashcards

You end up with a fully-fledged solution to micromanaging personal translation tasks.
